Health monitoring is a novel method for determining the health status of the general public. As convenient as it can be, it still may become a burden for these people because of the complexity of the results. Therefore, the aim of our project is to build a platform for detecting disease indicators. This platform is used to sense the different concentration levels of a disease-correlating index, with the results sorted into three to four levels. The different levels thus demonstrate the health degree of the patient.
The results are analyzed based on the luminescence of different florescent proteins. The use of these different colors make the results easily identifiable and quickly understood. We hope that this platform will provide a simple platform for the wide public to check their health easily and detect possible health problems without having to go to the hospital. Furthermore, we wish to provide this platform of biological detection as a basis for the future medical detection development, and thus contribute to our society.
