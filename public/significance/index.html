        <p>This would be a break through in the medical field.<br />
The sensor would be used for various detection.
For example we can use this to benefit the people by using it for disease detection and prevention as would be stated below.
Concerning social values:
It can be used as a disease detector for, let’s say, the elderly. This can act as a means of caution to prevent certain diseases from dominating the human body too rapidly.
It would be a great aid especially to those elders who tend to live alone. Many of them become the victims of diseases which in its first stage is editable but worsen through time.
With our idea and the aid of experts, our project would be able to benefit our society.
We can send our production in to hospitals or pharmaceutical companies, so that people would get access to it.
Hospitals would be able to detect diseases more easily, influencing not only the older population but the society as a whole, even saving some lives, maybe.
Pharmaceutical companies can use the idea of our project for research purposes. Experiments may be made and new forms of medicine may be created.
Thus, our project contains not only scientific but also societal values.</p>
