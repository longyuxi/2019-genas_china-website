        <p>Health monitoring is recently a way the public rely on to detect their health level, which can be a burden to some people and easily cause misunderstanding. Therefore, our project is to build a platform to detect disease indicators, like intestinal inflammation, and then this platform can sense different concentration ranges of the same index, which then be divided into three or four levels. This shows the concentration of the index and thus indicates the health degree. The results were characterized by different fluorescent proteins, which is easily to be seen and understood.We hope that the model we made will one day help the people who want to detect health problems to check themselves more easily. Furthermore, we have the wish to provide the concept of the biological detection to the future medical detection and make a contribution to the whole society.</p>
