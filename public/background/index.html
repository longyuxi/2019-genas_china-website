        <p>Nowadays, more and more diseases are plaguing people&rsquo;s health. Therefore, people often need to go to the hospital for physical examination to know their health level. However, it is not only time-consuming, laborious and inconvenient to go to the hospital for medical examination, but also more troublesome that people usually cannot understand the meaning of the various indicators on the medical examination report very well. Generally speaking, human diseases can often be observed by the concentration of a substance in the body, with high and low thresholds. In order to prevent those unnecessary troubles from happening, we designed a universal platform for people to detect indicators. Compared with physical examination in hospital, our product is much more convenient and simpler to use. With our products, measurements can be made at home. Moreover, we use simple and clear color as the expression of concentration range, which avoids the troubles caused by the lack of understanding the meaning of the numbers on the medical examination reports.</p>
